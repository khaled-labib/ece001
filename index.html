<h2 style="color:red;"><u>Introduction to Programming Languages:</u></h2>
<p>the only language the computer can understand is called binary. This binary language is 0 and 1 language. The first simple high-level programming language was designed in 1950 by john mauchly and it was named after him. This simple start was the shining of coding. So this languages has some kind of translator to turn this instructions to binary .this translator in the most traditional languages is called compiler. Compiler works simply by converting programming languages or source languages into machine code to be executed by the hardware. This source code needs also instructions to be followed to form a valid code to be compiled. The programming languages varies by this instructions of writing.
