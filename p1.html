<p>In 1936  for the first time the codes were specialized by Alan Turing and Alonzo church explaining lambda calculus in a formulaic way. The first electrically -powered computer was invented in 1940.</p>
<p>This computers were made with limited speed and memory. Because of that the programs were forced to be written in a low-level programming languages which was very hard to do. Here the coders realized the need of high-level programming languages.</p>
<p>Konrad zuse purposed the idea of the first high-level language. He invented  plankalkul between 1943 and 1945 but it wasn’t implemented. Then in 1950 William f Schmidt implemented  john mauchly’s  short code. It had a disadvantage every time it runs a program must  be translated to machine language. That was taking so much time and slowing the process. In 1952 Alick Glennie developed an autocode . this autocode was the first compiled language that converts directly into machine code. Autocode was faster than the other programs but almost has no popularity.</p>
<p>The first popular language was invented by a team in IBM in 1954 . this  high-level language is still in use until our time. Our popular languages now like java ,c ,c++ has a starting point in 1958 by scientific committee for scientific uses. These languages is based somehow in basic language called ALGOL . this language was developed before.</p>
