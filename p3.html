<p>We have no doubts that artificial intelligence is our future and programming language has an important role on it. There are many languages that is used in AI like python, Java and R.</p>
<p>Python is used so much because of its simplicity of syntaxes . Many AI algorithms are implemented in python and takes less time in development than Java, C++ and Ruby . python has many libraries which makes the task can be done easily. For instance Numpy is a library in python that is used for solving scientific computations and pybrain which is used in machine learning.</p>

<p>Java is considered a good language for AI development. AI is exposed a lot for search algorithms and genetic programs. Java has many benefits like easy use and package services, simple work with large projects and can graphically represent data. It has swing and swt incorporated with it that makes graphics look appealing.</p>
<p>The last programming language to talk about its role in AI is R language .R is the most effective programming language analyzing the data for statistical needs. R can easily build a good designed publication-quality piece, including mathematical symbols. It has a variety of packages such as Gmodels and tm. These packages make it easy to apply machine learning algorithms to solve business related problems.</p>
<p>To come to a fair conclusion there are many programming languages and are used in different places and fields. These languages varies in its syntax and its use and developers has enhanced it to have few bugs . human has evolved in this domain and has the most benefit of it by making it ease more everyday.</p>
