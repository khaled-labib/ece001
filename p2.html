<b><p>After knowing the history of programming languages, we should know the types of programming languages and their uses so we have eight basic languages to talk about these languages are:</p></b>
<ol>
  <b><li>C:</li></b>
  <p style="color:purple">It’s very powerful language and most of the other languages developers have inspired so much from it. Its also used for enhancing system applications such as Unix , windows and Linux and implanted or embedded software. And has a big role in artificial intelligence , and image processing.</p>
  <b><li>Paython:</li></b>
  <p style="color:purple">It may be the easiest and earliest language to start with because it has a user-friendly syntax .that makes it widely used and has a big community. Python is considered a high-level programming language . it’s commonly used for web applications and game enhancement , machine learning.</p>
  <b><li>Java:</li></b>
  <p style="color:purple">Java is a popular language too but it doesn’t look like python. It isn’t a good choice to start your journey in programming because it doesn’t have a friendly syntax. It was basically developed to feel like c++  but easy to use. Java is a high-level language. One of its pros that is very secure language and powerful so we realize that it will be used in something must be secured.</p>
  <b><li>C++:</li></b>
  <p style="color:purple">C++ is a middle-level programming language. It was created to be protraction of  C Programming language to provide higher-level abstraction and in the same time to be powerful and efficient like C.</p>
  <b><li>Javascript:</li></b>
  <p style="color:purple">JavaScript works on the user’s browser and doesn’t interact with the server. Some people think that JavaScript and java are similar.  They are very different. JavaScript is used for programming web that we are interacting with everyday.</p>
  <b><li>C#:</li></b>
  <p style="color:purple">C# was first developed in 2000s by Microsoft based on C , C++ and Java in the end it looks like them much and as advantage C#  language provides several types of logic. It’s also used for enhancing and developing windows applications and games. It can be used in every field too including web applications and android development.</p>
  <b><li>PHP:</li></b>
  <p style="color:purple">PHP is similar to C# in supporting several types of logic or paradigms. It’s created for designing dynamic web pages which work with databases so that means this programming language is essentially used in web development and command line scripting.</p>
  <b><li>Ruby:</li></b>
  <p style="color:purple"> Ruby is a high-level programming language and any beginner can start with it. And you can start constructing things so fast with a framework called rails. Its used for developing web apps, robotics and system administration and it works very good with simulations. That makes it used by NASA and other big organization like Github, scribd and Motorola, twitter and Groupon were created in the first place by ruby on rails. Yukihiro Matsumoto made it to look simple from outside and very complex from inside.</p>
